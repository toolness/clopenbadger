# openbadger

Badging.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have [redis](http://redis.io) and [mongo](http://mongodb.org/)
installed or hosted somewhere. You'll also need node.

# Local configuration

Here is an example configuration. This assumes you are running redis
and mongo locally.

```bash
export NODE_ENV="development"
export OPENBADGER_HOST="localhost"
export OPENBADGER_PROTOCOL="http"
export OPENBADGER_PORT=3000
export OPENBADGER_PERSONA_AUDIENCE="http://localhost:3000"
export OPENBADGER_LOGDIR='.'
export OPENBADGER_SECRET="badgerbadgerbadgerbadger"
export OPENBADGER_REDIS_HOST="localhost"
export OPENBADGER_REDIS_PORT=6379
export OPENBADGER_MONGO_HOST="localhost"
export OPENBADGER_MONGO_PORT=27017
export OPENBADGER_MONGO_DB="openbadger"
export OPENBADGER_ADMINS='["*@mozilla(foundation)?.org"]'
```

You can either paste that directly into your terminal, or you can put
that in a file and `source` it. For example, if you save a version of
this at `config.env`, do:

```bash
$ source config.env
```

## Using memcached instead of redis for sessions
In some cases (such as deploying on AWS) it might be easier to use memcached rather than redis.

```bash
export OPENBADGER_MEMCACHED_HOSTS="127.0.0.1:11211"
```

Note the use of `HOSTS` in the plural â€“ the memcached session store supports using multiple servers, so you can pass in an array of memcached instances if necessary.

# Installing deps & starting the server

```bash
$ make     # will do `npm install` and then start server
```

# Running the test suite

The test suite looks at all of the same environment variables, however
it makes sure that `NODE_ENV` is either "development" or "travis" (for
TravisCI). You can use the following commands to run the entire suite:

```bash
$ make test         # normally you'd use this
$ make verbose-test # if you want to see debugging
$ make lint         # to lint the codebase
```

You can also run the tests one-off by doing
`node tests/<name-of-file>.js`. This is useful for when one file is
giving you trouble and you don't want to run through the whole suite
to debug just that one thing.

# CloudFoundry configuration

```bash

$ vmc login

$ vmc push clopenbadger --runtime node08 --mem 128M --no-start

    Application Deployed URL [clopenbadger.vcap.mozillalabs.com]:

$ vmc restart clopenbadger

# Heroku configuration

You should only have to do the following once:

```bash
$ heroku login
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: brian@mozillafoundation.org
    Password:
    Could not find an existing public key.
    Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
    Generating new SSH public key.
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/brian/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

$ heroku create

       bcd2285..cce42fa  master -> master

$ heroku ps:scale web=1
    Scaling web processes... done, now running 1
```

Now, you must set the heroku environment configs. It's very similar to
setting local env configs, only you use `heroku config:add` instead of
`export`:

```bash
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_HOST="evening-fjord-7837.herokuapp.com"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_PROTOCOL="http"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_PORT=80
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_LOGDIR='.'
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_PERSONA_AUDIENCE="http://evening-fjord-7837.herokuapp.com"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_SECRET="19ofOKiFSr8aCyRpH2ohmfh5O7dOpReCHa9vkeoWJCWP72oVb"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_REDIS_HOST="your-redis-host.org"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_REDIS_PORT=6379
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_MONGO_HOST="your-mongo-host.org"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_MONGO_PORT=27017
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_MONGO_DB="openbadger"
heroku config:add OPENBADGER_ADMINS='["*@mozilla(foundation)?.org"]'
```

# Deploying to Heroku

```bash
$ make heroku    # deploy if out of date & opens in your browser
```
